# Key concepts of cloud computing and Azure

**Cloud computing** has a wide range of real-world applications and benefits that make it integral to our daily lives and businesses. Here's how it helps in the real world:

**Data Storage and Accessibility:** Cloud services like Google Drive, Dropbox, and iCloud allow individuals and businesses to store vast amounts of data online, making it accessible from any device with an internet connection. This eliminates the need for physical storage hardware and allows for seamless access to files anytime, anywhere.

**Collaboration:** Cloud-based tools like Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and Slack enable real-time collaboration. Teams can work together on documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and even video calls, no matter where they are located. This has been especially helpful for remote work and global teams.

### How can it benefit a Business

Cloud computing offers businesses numerous benefits, helping them streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve flexibility. Here's how it can benefit a business:

1. **Cost Efficiency**
   
•	Reduced IT Costs: Cloud computing eliminates the need for purchasing expensive hardware, maintaining servers, and paying for software licenses. Businesses can pay only for what they use, saving money on infrastructure, utilities, and personnel for managing hardware.

•	Pay-as-you-go Pricing: With cloud services, businesses can scale their resources up or down depending on their needs, ensuring they only pay for the services they actually use, rather than overcommitting to resources they don't need.

2. **Scalability and Flexibility**
   
•	Adapt to Business Growth: Cloud computing allows businesses to easily scale up (or down) their storage, computing power, or software needs. For example, during peak sales seasons, companies can increase server capacity to handle higher traffic and then reduce it when demand normalizes.

•	Elastic Resources: Cloud services like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud offer flexible resources that businesses can adjust as needed, making it easier to meet fluctuating demand

### What’s the alternative to cloud computing?

The main alternative to cloud computing is on-premises computing, which involves maintaining IT infrastructure and data storage within a company's own facilities. This can include:

1. **On-Premises Servers and Infrastructure:**

With on-premises computing, businesses buy, manage, and maintain their own servers, storage, and network infrastructure within their physical premises.

2. **Colocation (Colo)**
   
Colocation involves renting space in a data centre to house a company's physical servers and hardware. The business owns the hardware, but the data centre provides the space, power, cooling, and network connectivity.

3. **Private Hosting**
   
In this model, a business rents dedicated hosting services from a provider, where they have exclusive use of a server or a set of servers. The infrastructure is managed by the hosting company but is typically more customizable than shared hosting.

4. **Hybrid Cloud**
   
A hybrid cloud is a combination of on-premises infrastructure and cloud computing, allowing businesses to run certain applications or store data in the cloud, while maintaining others in their own data centres.

5. **Edge Computing**
   
Edge computing involves processing data closer to where it's generated (e.g., on devices or local servers) instead of sending it to centralised cloud data centres. This is often used for real-time, low-latency applications, such as in the Internet of Things (IoT).

### What cloud providers can we use, what are their features and functions?

There are several major cloud providers that businesses and individuals can use, each offering a wide range of services, features, and functions to meet different needs. Below are the most prominent cloud providers, along with a summary of their key offerings:

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)**

AWS is one of the largest and most widely used cloud platforms in the world. It provides a comprehensive suite of cloud services for computing, storage, databases, machine learning, analytics, networking, and more.

2. **Microsoft Azure**
   
Microsoft Azure is a leading cloud platform that integrates with many Microsoft services and tools. It provides a range of cloud computing services, including virtual machines, databases, and AI.

3. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
   
Google Cloud is known for its strengths in data analytics, machine learning, and big data solutions. GCP provides a wide range of infrastructure services, as well as advanced tools for building and scaling applications.

### Public Cloud:

Public cloud refers to a cloud computing model where computing resources like servers, storage, and applications are provided by third-party service providers and are made available to the general public over the internet. These resources are shared among multiple organisations (often called tenants) but are securely isolated, meaning each tenant's data and applications are separate from others.

### Private Cloud:

Private cloud refers to a cloud computing model where the infrastructure is dedicated to a single organisation. It can be hosted either on-premises (within the organisation's own data centre) or by a third-party provider but is still isolated from other organisations. The organisation has more control over the infrastructure, security, and customisation, which is a key difference from a public cloud, where resources are shared among multiple tenants.

### Hybrid cloud:

Hybrid cloud is a cloud computing model that combines both public and private cloud environments, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. This gives organisations more flexibility and deployment options. With a hybrid cloud, businesses can leverage the public cloud for non-sensitive workloads and the private cloud for sensitive data or critical applications, providing the best of both worlds.

### Community Cloud:

Community cloud is a cloud computing model where infrastructure is shared by several organisations with similar interests, needs, or regulatory requirements. It can be hosted by a third-party provider or managed internally, but the key aspect is that the cloud is used by multiple organisations with a shared goal, often for collaboration, security, or compliance purposes. The resources are dedicated to a specific community, and the costs are shared among the members of that community.
